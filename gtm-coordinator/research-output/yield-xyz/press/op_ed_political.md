By prioritizing self-custody, Yield.xyz empowers users to be the true stewards of their financial destinies.

It allows users to bypass gatekeepers, reduce fees, and engage with a global financial network that operates 24/7. By fostering an ecosystem that prioritizes self-custody and decentralization, Yield.xyz is paving the way for a more inclusive financial future.
