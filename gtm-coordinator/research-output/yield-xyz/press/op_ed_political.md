**Main Argument about Self-Custody Rights:**

In the current regulatory environment, self-custody rights have become a focal point of debate. As governments and regulatory bodies such as the SEC attempt to cast a wider net over digital assets, the fundamental right of individuals to control their financial destinies is more critical than ever. Yield.xyz's integration underscores the importance of self-custody, providing users with the tools to manage their assets independently, free from third-party control and intervention.

**How This Integration Supports Financial Sovereignty:**

Yield.xyz's integration is not just a technological advancement; it is a statement in favor of financial sovereignty. By enabling users to directly engage with yield-generating opportunities without intermediaries, it offers a practical solution to maintaining control over one's financial assets. This approach aligns with the growing demand for decentralized finance mechanisms that empower individuals rather than institutions. In an era where regulatory bodies are tightening their grip, Yield.xyz is pioneering a path that prioritizes user autonomy and decentralization.
