**DENVER, CO, March 3, 2026** — ShapeShift DAO, a leading decentralized exchange and cryptocurrency platform, announces its integration with Yield.xyz, the ultimate Web3 yield infrastructure. This strategic partnership will enable ShapeShift users to access a wide array of yield opportunities across multiple blockchain networks, all from within the ShapeShift platform.

The integration will leverage Yield.xyz’s unified API, which spans over 75 networks and supports 13 major blockchain networks including Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon. This will allow ShapeShift users to explore yield opportunities across 29 different asset symbols and engage with 18 providers and protocols such as Aave, Lido, and Yearn.

The collaboration between ShapeShift and Yield.xyz also opens up new avenues for staking solutions and yield analytics, further enriching the user experience. By utilizing Yield.xyz's data APIs, ShapeShift can offer comprehensive yield analytics, enabling users to make informed decisions and optimize their investment strategies. This integration underscores ShapeShift’s commitment to providing its community with cutting-edge tools and opportunities in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.

Yield.xyz distinguishes itself from competitors such as Yearn Finance and Lido through its broader network reach and unified API, which simplifies access to yield opportunities. This partnership is a testament to ShapeShift's dedication to staying at the forefront of innovation by integrating leading-edge solutions that align with its mission to empower users in the decentralized ecosystem.
