**[DENVER, CO, October 20, 2023]** – ShapeShift DAO, a leading decentralized cryptocurrency trading platform, is thrilled to announce its integration with Yield.xyz, a comprehensive Web3 yield infrastructure provider. This strategic collaboration aims to bring advanced staking solutions and DeFi yield strategies directly to ShapeShift users, enhancing their ability to maximize returns within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

This integration, effective immediately, allows ShapeShift users to access Yield.xyz's suite of yield-generating tools and data APIs. By leveraging Yield.xyz's cross-chain technology and advanced DeFi strategies, users can now manage their assets more efficiently and securely, all while maintaining complete control over their funds.

Yield.xyz is renowned for its user-friendly interface and robust data APIs, which provide developers and investors with the tools necessary to navigate the complex DeFi landscape. The integration will enable ShapeShift users to benefit from comprehensive staking solutions and high-performance analytics, further solidifying ShapeShift's commitment to providing a seamless and efficient trading experience.

"By integrating Yield.xyz's innovative yield infrastructure, ShapeShift is empowering its users to earn yield without losing control of their assets," said [NAME], [TITLE] at ShapeShift. "This partnership underscores our dedication to enhancing the DeFi experience by offering cutting-edge solutions that meet the needs of both individual and institutional investors."

The collaboration opens up several integration opportunities, including the incorporation of Yield.xyz's staking solutions into ShapeShift's platform and the utilization of Yield.xyz's data APIs for enhanced analytics. Additionally, both entities will explore joint cross-chain yield strategies, aiming to deliver superior returns for their users.
