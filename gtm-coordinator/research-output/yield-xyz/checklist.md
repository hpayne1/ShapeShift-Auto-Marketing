## Before You Start: New Packet?

If you're generating a **new** GTM full packet (not using existing materials), fill out [research/gtm_discovery_questionnaire.md](research/gtm_discovery_questionnaire.md) first. It captures launch date, CTA URL, protocol roster by chain, campaign type, and co-marketing details.

# You Shipped Code. Now Tell People About It.

You merged a PR. A feature is live. This packet helps you announce it.

At ShapeShift, engineers own their launches. There's no marketing team.
Things don't blow up on their own. If you don't market it, no one will use it.

This isn't busywork. It's intentional storytelling for the tech you built.
