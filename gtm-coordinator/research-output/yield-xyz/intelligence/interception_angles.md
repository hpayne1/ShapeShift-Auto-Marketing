## User Problems We're Solving

1. **Idle assets earning nothing.** Users hold USDC, ETH, SOL and earn 0% because they haven't set up staking or yield positions.
2. **CEX custody risk.** Post-FTX, post-Celsius: users want to earn but don't trust centralized platforms with their keys.
3. **KYC friction.** Users don't want to hand over identity documents to earn yield on assets they already own.
4. **Multi-platform fatigue.** Managing yield across Aave, Lido, Yearn, Kamino, etc. on different chains is exhausting.
5. **Complexity barrier.** Users know yield exists but don't know where to start or which protocol to trust.
6. **Low yield / rate-shopping.** Users on one platform don't know if they could earn more elsewhere.

## How to Use These

- **Social:** Pick 2-3 hooks per week for the content calendar. Rotate between problem-led hooks (from this doc) and announcement-led posts (from drafts/).
- **Press:** Use headline pitches as story subjects when pitching outlets. Pair with the press release from `press/press_release.md` and the PR brief from `press/pr_brief.md`.
- **Community:** Post 1-2 conversation starters per week in Discord #general or Reddit. Respond to every reply.
- **Calendar:** Add these to `calendar/content_calendar.md` — interleave with existing announcement cadence so weeks 2-4 aren't just "hey we launched this."
- **SEO:** Cross-reference with `research/seo_topics.md` — social hooks can become blog intros, and vice versa.
