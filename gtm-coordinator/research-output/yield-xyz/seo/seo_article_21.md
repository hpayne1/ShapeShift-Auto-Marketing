# How to Avoid CEX Custody Risk and Still Earn Yield

Centralized exchanges (CEXs) often require users to relinquish control of their assets, creating potential custody risks. What if you could earn yield without handing over your keys? Discover how decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like ShapeShift and Yield.xyz offer a secure pathway to earning yield while maintaining self-custody.

## Understanding CEX Custody Risks

Centralized exchanges serve as intermediaries, holding users' assets in their wallets. While convenient, this model poses significant risks:

- **Loss of Control**: Users must trust the exchange to manage their assets securely.
- **Security Breaches**: CEXs are prime targets for hackers due to the vast amounts of assets held.
- **Regulatory Risks**: Changes in regulations can affect access to funds or services.

To mitigate these risks, many crypto enthusiasts are turning to DeFi solutions that prioritize self-custody.

## How DeFi Ensures Self-Custody

Decentralized finance platforms empower users by eliminating the need for intermediaries. With DeFi, individuals maintain control over their private keys, ensuring that only they can access their assets. This self-sovereign approach aligns with the vision of a borderless financial system that is open and in your hands.
