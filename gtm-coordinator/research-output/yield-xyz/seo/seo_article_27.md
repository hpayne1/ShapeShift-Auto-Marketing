# Lido on ShapeShift vs Lido Direct: What's Different?

When considering staking Ethereum with Lido, users often wonder about the differences between using Lido directly and accessing it through ShapeShift. Both options offer unique advantages, yet they cater to different user needs and preferences. This article explores these differences, helping you make an informed decision on where to stake your ETH.

## Understanding Lido: A Brief Overview

Lido is a decentralized staking solution for Ethereum and other proof-of-stake (PoS) networks. It allows users to stake their tokens without locking them up, providing liquidity through staked token derivatives. This means users can continue to trade or use their assets in DeFi applications while earning staking rewards.

### How Lido Works

- **Stake ETH**: Users deposit ETH into the Lido protocol.
- **Receive stETH**: In return, they receive stETH, a tokenized version of staked ETH.
- **Earn Rewards**: stETH holders earn rewards, reflecting their share of the total staked ETH in Lido.

## Lido Direct: The Traditional Route

Staking directly with Lido involves interacting with its official platform. This route is straightforward for those familiar with DeFi protocols.

### Advantages of Using Lido Direct

1. **Direct Access**: Engage directly with Lido’s smart contracts.
2. **Transparency**: Monitor staking operations and rewards without intermediaries.
3. **Network Integration**: Lido’s native platform is often integrated with multiple DeFi applications, allowing for versatile use of stETH.

### Considerations for Lido Direct Users

- **Technical Expertise Required**: Users need to be comfortable navigating DeFi platforms.
- **Custodial Responsibility**: Users manage their own wallets and private keys.
