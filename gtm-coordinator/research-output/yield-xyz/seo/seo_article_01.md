## Understanding Rewards and Mechanics

Rewards distribution through Yield.xyz is a crucial aspect of the integration. Here's a general overview of how it works:

- **Rewards Accumulation:** As you stake your assets, rewards accumulate based on the performance of the chosen network and asset. It's important to note that the rewards distribution is off-chain, meaning that while you can track your earnings, they are not reflected on the blockchain in real-time.

- **Epoch and Cooldown Mechanics:** Some staking protocols may involve epoch and cooldown periods. During an epoch, rewards are calculated and distributed. A cooldown period may be required before you can withdraw your staked assets, ensuring network stability and security.

### Disclaimer

Please be aware that while Yield.xyz offers significant yield opportunities, the rewards distribution is off-chain. This means that while you can see your potential earnings, they are not immediately available on the blockchain. Additionally, no specific Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is promised, as returns can vary based on market conditions and network performance.
