# Discover DeFi Yield Without Giving Up Your Keys

In the evolving landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi), the quest for earning yield without relinquishing control of your assets is paramount. Many seek to generate DeFi yield without giving up their keys, ensuring both security and autonomy. Yield.xyz offers a seamless solution, providing a comprehensive infrastructure to stake assets across multiple blockchain networks while maintaining full self-custody.

## What is DeFi Yield and Why Self-Custody Matters?

DeFi yield refers to the returns earned from various decentralized finance activities, such as staking, lending, and participating in liquidity pools. Unlike traditional finance, DeFi enables users to earn yield directly from their crypto assets without intermediaries.

Self-custody is the practice of holding and managing one's own private keys, which are essential for accessing and controlling digital assets. This approach ensures that users maintain complete control over their funds, protecting them from third-party risks associated with centralized exchanges or custodial services.
