## How Aave Works: A General Overview

Aave operates by pooling funds from depositors, which are then made available for borrowers. Here's a simplified breakdown of how it functions:

- **Depositors:** Provide liquidity to the Aave protocol by depositing assets into the pool. In return, they earn interest over time.
- **Borrowers:** Access funds from the pool by providing collateral. Borrowers pay interest on the borrowed amount, which is distributed to depositors.
- **Aave Tokens (aTokens):** When you deposit assets, you receive aTokens, which represent your stake and accrue interest over time.
