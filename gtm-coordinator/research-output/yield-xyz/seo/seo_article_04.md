# How to Stake ETH and Keep Your Private Keys

Staking Ethereum (ETH) while retaining control of your private keys is a priority for many decentralized finance (DeFi) enthusiasts. This approach ensures that you maintain self-custody, a principle at the heart of the decentralized movement. In this guide, we'll explore how you can stake ETH without relinquishing your keys, using Yield.xyz and ShapeShift as your primary tools.

## Understanding ETH Staking and Self-Custody

Staking ETH involves participating in the Ethereum network's consensus process by locking up your ETH to support network operations. In return, you earn rewards. However, traditional staking methods often require you to hand over your private keys, compromising your control. Self-custody staking, on the other hand, allows you to keep your keys secure while still participating in the staking process.

### Why Self-Custody Matters

- **Security**: Retain control over your assets without relying on third parties.
- **Privacy**: Avoid unnecessary sharing of personal information.
- **Autonomy**: Make independent decisions about your assets.
