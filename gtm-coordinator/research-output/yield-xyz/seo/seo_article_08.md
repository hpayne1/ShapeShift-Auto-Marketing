# How to Earn on ATOM with No KYC

Are you looking to earn on ATOM without the hassle of Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures? You're not alone. Many crypto enthusiasts seek ways to maximize their returns while maintaining privacy and control over their assets. This guide will walk you through how to earn on ATOM using decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols that prioritize self-custody and privacy.

## Why Choose No KYC Options?

KYC procedures are standard in traditional financial systems, often seen as intrusive and time-consuming. For those who value privacy and control, avoiding KYC is a priority. The rise of DeFi has provided alternatives that allow users to participate in financial activities without compromising their personal information.

### The Power of Self-Custody

Self-custody means you hold your private keys and have full control over your assets. This approach aligns with ShapeShift's vision of a self-custodial future where finance is sovereign and borderless. By choosing platforms that support self-custody, you ensure that your assets remain in your hands, not in the hands of third parties.

## How Staking Works

Staking is a fundamental component of many blockchain networks, including Cosmos, which ATOM belongs to. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

- **Validator Selection:** Stakers delegate their tokens to validators, who are responsible for maintaining the network.
- **Earning Rewards:** By participating in the network's security and operations, stakers earn rewards, typically paid out in the same cryptocurrency they staked.
- **Lock-up Periods:** Some staking platforms have lock-up periods where your tokens are inaccessible. Yield.xyz provides clear information on these terms, allowing for informed decision-making.
