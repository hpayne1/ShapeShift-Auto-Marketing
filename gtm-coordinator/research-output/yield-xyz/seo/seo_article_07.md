## How Does Staking Work?

Staking involves locking up a portion of your cryptocurrency to support the operations of a blockchain network. In return, you earn rewards over time. Here's a quick overview of how staking works:

- **Validators:** These are nodes that validate transactions and maintain the network's integrity.
- **Delegation:** By staking your SOL, you delegate it to validators, who perform the work on your behalf.
- **Rewards:** Validators distribute rewards to you based on the amount of SOL you have staked.
