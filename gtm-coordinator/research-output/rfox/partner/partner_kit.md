rFOX is now live. Stake FOX on Arbitrum, earn USDC. Rewards sent to your wallet on the 15th of each month.

**Key Messages:**
- No custody, no KYC—your keys, your control.
- Get paid in USDC, not volatile reward tokens.
- Bridge FOX to Arbitrum in the ShapeShift UI if on mainnet; 28-day cooldown when unstaking before FOX can be claimed.
- Rewards from a share of the DAO's affiliate-fee revenue; accounting on IPFS and forum each epoch—verify with the [rFOX repo](https://github.com/shapeshift/rFOX) CLI.
