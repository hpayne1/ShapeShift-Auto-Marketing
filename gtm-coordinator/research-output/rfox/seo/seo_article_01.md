# Understanding the rFOX Program on ShapeShift: A Comprehensive Guide

In the rapidly evolving landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi), ShapeShift stands out as a beacon for self-sovereign finance. With its latest offering, the rFOX program, ShapeShift continues to empower individuals with the tools they need to participate in a decentralized financial ecosystem. In this article, we will delve into the intricacies of the rFOX program, guide you through the staking process, and explain how rewards are distributed. 

## What is the rFOX Program?

The rFOX program is a staking initiative on ShapeShift that allows users to stake their FOX tokens and earn USDC rewards. Unlike traditional staking protocols that may offer volatile reward tokens, rFOX ensures that earnings are distributed in a stable currency, USDC, providing users with a predictable return. This program is designed to align with ShapeShift’s mission of fostering open, borderless finance where users maintain control over their assets.

### Key Features of the rFOX Program

- **Stake FOX, Earn USDC**: Participants can stake their FOX tokens and receive rewards in USDC, the stablecoin, ensuring a consistent value.
- **No Custody, No KYC**: True to ShapeShift’s principles, the rFOX program requires no custody of your assets and no Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. Your keys, your control.
- **Monthly Rewards**: Rewards are distributed monthly, landing directly in your wallet, making it a convenient and hassle-free experience.

## Understanding the Rewards System

The rFOX program rewards participants with USDC, distributed directly to their wallets every month. This off-chain distribution by the DAO multisig ensures transparency and reliability. It is important to note that while the program offers consistent rewards, it does not promise specific annual percentage yields (APY) or returns.

### How Rewards Are Calculated

Rewards in the rFOX program are calculated based on the amount of FOX tokens staked and the overall performance of the program. While specific APYs are not promised, the structure is designed to provide a fair distribution of earnings among participants.

## Epoch and Cooldown Mechanics

The rFOX program operates with specific epoch and cooldown mechanics to manage staking and reward distribution effectively:

- **Epoch Duration**: The program operates on a monthly epoch basis, meaning rewards are calculated and distributed every month. This regular cycle ensures participants receive their earnings promptly.
  
- **Cooldown Period**: If you decide to unstake your FOX tokens, a cooldown period may apply. This period is essential for maintaining the integrity of the reward distribution system and ensuring all participants have a fair opportunity to earn.
