## Understanding the Rewards System

The rewards system of the rFOX program is designed to be both rewarding and fair. Here's how it works:

- **USDC Revenue Share**: Rewards are distributed as USDC, offering a stable and widely accepted form of value. This ensures that participants receive tangible benefits from their staking activities.

- **Off-Chain Distribution**: Rewards are managed off-chain by a DAO multisig, ensuring transparency and community governance. The USDC rewards are paid directly to the staker's wallet.

- **No Promise of APY**: While the rewards system is designed to be beneficial, ShapeShift does not promise specific APY or return rates. The focus is on providing a fair distribution of USDC revenue share to all participants.

### Epoch and Cooldown Mechanics

The rFOX program incorporates epoch and cooldown mechanics to manage staking periods and reward distribution:

- **Epochs**: Staking rewards are calculated and distributed in defined epochs. This cyclical approach ensures that rewards are evenly distributed over time.

- **Cooldown Periods**: Upon initiating an unstake request, a cooldown period may apply. This mechanism ensures the stability of the staking pool and maintains fairness among all participants.
