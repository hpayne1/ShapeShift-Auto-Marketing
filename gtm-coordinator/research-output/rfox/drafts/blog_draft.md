# Introducing rFOX: Stake FOX and Earn USDC with ShapeShift

Decentralized finance continues to evolve, offering enthusiasts new ways to engage with digital assets while maintaining control over their funds. ShapeShift has launched the rFOX program for DeFi power users and yield seekers. With rFOX, users can now stake their FOX tokens and earn USDC rewards directly into their wallets every month.

## A New Opportunity for FOX Holders

Imagine a world where earning yield doesn't require surrendering your keys or compromising on your privacy. With the launch of rFOX on ShapeShift, this vision is now a reality. DeFi enthusiasts can stake their FOX tokens and enjoy the benefits of earning stable USDC rewards each month. Say goodbye to complex processes and volatile reward tokens—rFOX streamlines the experience for those seeking efficiency and security.

## What is rFOX?

rFOX is a staking program on ShapeShift that lets users stake FOX on Arbitrum and receive USDC rewards. Rewards come from a share of the DAO's revenue from affiliate fees each epoch and are distributed off-chain by the DAO multisig—sent directly to the staker's wallet on the **15th of each month** for the preceding month. Unlike traditional yield farming that often uses volatile reward tokens, rFOX pays in stable USDC. The program requires no custody and no KYC. FOX must be bridged to Arbitrum in the ShapeShift UI before staking (mainnet FOX cannot be staked directly). When you unstake, you stop earning and enter a **28-day cooldown** before you can claim your FOX back. Accounting is published to IPFS and the forum each epoch; you can verify with the open source CLI in the [rFOX repo](https://github.com/shapeshift/rFOX).
