## What We're Announcing

ShapeShift now supports Zcash (ZEC) — users can send, receive, and swap ZEC directly from their self-custodial wallet. No KYC. No account. Just connect and go.

**Why This Matters for Zcash:**
This brings ZEC to ShapeShift's active user base of self-custody DeFi users who already care about privacy and sovereignty. More wallets holding ZEC, more swap volume, and broader visibility for Zcash in the multi-chain ecosystem. ShapeShift users are exactly the audience Zcash was built for.

**Key Messages:**
- Send, receive, and swap ZEC on ShapeShift — the original privacy coin meets the original self-custodial exchange.
- Transparent (t-address) support from day one; self-custodial, no KYC.
- ZEC is now a first-class citizen alongside BTC, ETH, and dozens of other assets on ShapeShift.
- Your keys, your ZEC. Privacy starts with self-custody.
