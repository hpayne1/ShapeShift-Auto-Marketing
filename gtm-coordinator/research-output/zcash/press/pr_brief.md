# PR Brief: Zcash Integration

## Key Messages (Memorize These)

**Primary:** ShapeShift adds native Zcash (ZEC) support — users can send, receive, and swap the original privacy coin from a self-custodial wallet with no KYC.

**Supporting:**
- ZEC joins BTC, ETH, and dozens of other assets on ShapeShift's multi-chain platform.
- Transparent t-address support from day one. Self-custodial, private by default.
- Privacy-conscious users now have a home for ZEC that doesn't require an account or identity verification.

**Tweet-Ready:** "Send, receive, and swap ZEC — the original privacy coin — on ShapeShift. No KYC. No custody. Your keys, your ZEC."

## Talking Points

1. **What is this?**
   ShapeShift now natively supports Zcash (ZEC). Users can send, receive, and swap ZEC using transparent t-addresses, directly from their own wallet. No account creation, no KYC, no custody.

2. **Why does it matter?**
   - Zcash is the original privacy coin — built on zk-SNARKs, the same zero-knowledge proof technology that now powers a significant portion of blockchain scaling (zk-rollups). Supporting ZEC on a self-custodial platform reinforces the principle that privacy and self-custody go hand in hand.
   - Many centralized exchanges have delisted privacy coins under regulatory pressure. ShapeShift offers a self-custodial alternative where ZEC remains accessible.
   - UTXO-based assets like ZEC represent a fundamentally different architecture from account-based chains — ShapeShift supporting both demonstrates genuine multi-chain capability.

3. **Who is this for?**
   - Existing ZEC holders who want a self-custodial swap option without KYC.
   - Privacy-conscious crypto users who want to diversify into or out of ZEC.
   - Long-time ShapeShift users who remember the original ZEC support and want it back.

4. **How is this different from competitors?**
   - Fully self-custodial: ShapeShift never holds user funds. Users connect their own wallet and maintain complete control.
   - No KYC: Unlike centralized exchanges that have delisted ZEC or added identity requirements, ShapeShift doesn't require accounts or verification.
   - Multi-chain swap: Users can swap ZEC against assets on other chains (BTC, ETH, etc.) — not just trade within a single ecosystem.

## Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: Does ShapeShift support shielded (z-address) transactions?**
A: This integration supports transparent t-addresses. Shielded transaction support is something we'd love to explore in the future as the ecosystem evolves.

**Q: Why add a privacy coin when regulators are cracking down?**
A: Financial privacy is a fundamental right. ZEC's transparent transactions are fully auditable on-chain — this is no different from supporting BTC. Self-custodial platforms exist precisely so users can make their own choices about which assets to hold.

**Q: Is this safe? Isn't ZEC used for illicit activity?**
A: ZEC transparent transactions are visible on-chain like any other UTXO chain. Chainalysis and other analytics firms support ZEC. The vast majority of ZEC usage is ordinary financial activity. Privacy is not a crime.

**Q: When is this available?**
A: Available now at app.shapeshift.com.

**Q: What can users do with ZEC on ShapeShift?**
A: Send ZEC, receive ZEC, and swap ZEC to/from other supported assets. All self-custodial.

**Q: Will ShapeShift add more privacy coins?**
A: We don't comment on specific asset roadmaps, but ShapeShift has a history of supporting a broad range of assets. Community governance plays a role in prioritization.
