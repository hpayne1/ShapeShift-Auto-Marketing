# Press Release

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**ShapeShift Adds Native Zcash (ZEC) Support: Send, Receive, and Swap the Original Privacy Coin — Self-Custodial, No KYC**

**[CITY, DATE]** — ShapeShift DAO, the decentralized, self-custodial crypto platform, today announced native support for Zcash (ZEC). ShapeShift users can now send, receive, and swap ZEC directly from their own wallets — no account creation, no KYC, no custody handoff.

Zcash, launched in 2016, is the original privacy-focused cryptocurrency and the first production deployment of zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge). ZEC uses a UTXO-based architecture similar to Bitcoin, with the added capability of shielded transactions for users who choose to use them. ShapeShift's integration supports transparent t-address transactions, enabling ZEC holders to manage and swap their assets alongside BTC, ETH, and dozens of other supported chains.

**Why It Matters**

As centralized exchanges face increasing pressure to delist privacy-focused assets, self-custodial platforms offer an alternative path. ShapeShift's addition of ZEC provides a venue where privacy-conscious users can hold and swap ZEC without identity verification or custodial risk.

The integration reflects ShapeShift's continued commitment to supporting a broad range of digital assets across multiple chains and architectures — from account-based chains like Ethereum to UTXO chains like Bitcoin and now Zcash.

**What Users Can Do**

- **Send ZEC** to any transparent Zcash address
- **Receive ZEC** into their self-custodial wallet
- **Swap ZEC** to and from other supported assets (BTC, ETH, and more)

All transactions are self-custodial. ShapeShift never takes possession of user funds.

**A Shared History**

ShapeShift was one of the first platforms to support Zcash after its 2016 launch. This integration continues a long-standing relationship between ShapeShift and the Zcash ecosystem, reaffirming the belief that financial privacy and self-custody are complementary values.

**Availability**

ZEC support is live now at [app.shapeshift.com](https://app.shapeshift.com).
