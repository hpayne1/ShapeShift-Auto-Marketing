# Marketing Brief: Zcash Integration

## Who Are We Speaking To?

**Target Audience:** Privacy-conscious crypto users (primary); Zcash holders wanting self-custody, UTXO coin holders wanting unified wallet management, users wanting to acquire ZEC without KYC

**What We Know About Them:** They care about financial privacy, prefer self-custody over exchanges, and want to hold and move ZEC alongside their other crypto. Many already hold BTC and understand UTXO-based coins. They distrust KYC-gated onramps and want a way to acquire ZEC that aligns with its privacy ethos.

**Psychographics:** They value sovereignty, privacy, and control. They see Zcash as more than a token — it represents encrypted digital cash and financial freedom. They want tools that respect those values, not platforms that compromise them.

## What Problem Are We Solving?

**The Problem:** Zcash holders have limited options for managing ZEC in a multichain wallet. The official Zashi wallet is ZEC-only. CEXs require KYC to buy or sell ZEC, which defeats the purpose of a privacy coin. Other multichain wallets are run by centralized companies with limited privacy commitments.

**The "Aha" Moment:** Users realize they can hold ZEC alongside BTC, ETH, and 100+ other assets in one self-custody wallet — and swap into ZEC from any supported token without signing up for an exchange.

**Before/After:**
Before: Use a CEX (with KYC) to buy ZEC, or manage it in a ZEC-only wallet separate from everything else. After: Send, receive, and swap ZEC in ShapeShift alongside all your other crypto. No accounts. No KYC. One wallet.

## Wild Success (Best Case Scenario)

**Vision:** ShapeShift becomes the default multichain home for Zcash holders — the place you go when you want ZEC in a real wallet alongside the rest of your portfolio, without KYC.

**Indicators:**
- Meaningful ZEC wallet activations within 30 days
- Zcash community organically recommending ShapeShift as a way to hold and swap ZEC
- Cross-pollination: ZEC users discovering and using other ShapeShift features (BTC, ETH, swaps)
- Partner amplification from Zcash ecosystem accounts

## Why ShapeShift? (vs Competitors)

**Differentiators:**
- **Multichain wallet:** Hold ZEC alongside BTC, ETH, and 100+ assets — Zashi is ZEC-only
- **Swap into ZEC from anything:** BTC→ZEC, ETH→ZEC, or any supported asset. No exchange account needed.
- **No KYC, no custody:** A privacy coin deserves a privacy-respecting platform. CEXs require KYC to touch ZEC.
- **UTXO management built in:** ShapeShift handles ZEC UTXOs the same way it handles Bitcoin — users don't have to think about it.
- **Not a centralized company:** Unlike Exodus, Trust Wallet, or Atomic Wallet, ShapeShift is a DAO.

**Positioning Statement:** ShapeShift is the only self-custodial multichain wallet where you can send, receive, and swap Zcash alongside all your other crypto — without KYC, without custody, without compromise.
