# Design Brief: Zcash Integration

## Concept

Announcement graphic for Zcash (ZEC) integration on ShapeShift. Visual theme: privacy, self-custody, and the convergence of two OG crypto brands. Dark, confident, clean — not flashy or hype-driven. The tone should feel like a long-overdue reunion, not a product launch.

## Dimensions Needed

- **Twitter:** 1200x675
- **Square** (Discord/Instagram): 1080x1080
- **Blog header:** 1600x900

## Brand Guidelines

**Colors:**
- Primary: `#3761F9` (ShapeShift blue)
- Background: `#1a1a2e` (dark)
- Accent: `#00D395` (ShapeShift green — use for CTAs or highlights)
- Partner Accent: `#F4B728` (Zcash yellow — use sparingly as a secondary accent)
- Text: `#FFFFFF`

**Color Usage Notes:**
- ShapeShift blue and Zcash yellow should feel complementary, not competing. Use Zcash yellow for the ZEC logo/shield and one accent element max. ShapeShift blue dominates.
- Avoid large blocks of yellow — it should feel like an accent, not a co-branded piece.

**Typography:**
- Headlines: Inter Bold
- Body: Space Grotesk

**Logos:**
- ShapeShift fox: corner placement (not center)
- Zcash logo/shield: can be centered or prominent
- Never distort, recolor, or overlay logos on busy backgrounds

## Visual Direction

Dark, minimal, high-contrast. Evokes privacy and security without being ominous or surveillance-themed.

- **Do:** Shield imagery, subtle lock/key motifs, clean geometry, dark gradients (subtle only)
- **Do:** Let negative space breathe — this is a confidence announcement
- **Don't:** Stock photos, 3D renders, excessive gradients, neon effects
- **Don't:** Surveillance imagery (cameras, eyes) — we're celebrating privacy, not illustrating threats

**Mood References:**
- The aesthetic of a well-designed hardware wallet box
- Apple product announcement restraint applied to crypto
- Think "dark mode by default"

## Must Include

- Zcash shield logo
- ShapeShift fox logo (subtle, corner)
- Key message: **"Send, receive, and swap ZEC — the original privacy coin — on ShapeShift."**
- CTA: `app.shapeshift.com`

## Text Hierarchy (for all formats)

1. **Headline:** "ZEC is live on ShapeShift" or "The Original Privacy Coin Meets the Original Self-Custodial Exchange"
2. **Subline:** "Send, receive, and swap Zcash. No KYC. Your keys, your ZEC."
3. **CTA:** app.shapeshift.com

## References

- Previous ShapeShift announcement graphics (maintain style consistency)

- ShapeShift brand: existing design system (dark theme, fox mark)
