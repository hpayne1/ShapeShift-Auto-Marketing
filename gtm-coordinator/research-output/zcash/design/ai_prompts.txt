## Tips

1. Generate 4-6 variations per prompt
2. Pick the cleanest composition with the most negative space
3. Add text overlay in Figma/Canva — AI-generated text is unreliable
4. Composite logos separately (download from z.cash/brand and ShapeShift brand kit)
5. Zcash yellow (#F4B728) should be an accent, not dominant — keep it to ~20% of color usage
6. If the output feels too "techy" or cold, try adding: "warm undertone, human, approachable"
