# Interception Content Angles: Zcash

**Packet:** gtm-coordinator/research-output/zcash
**Protocol category:** UTXO Chain / Privacy

## User Problems We're Solving

1. **KYC gatekeeping.** Most places to buy or swap into ZEC require identity verification. Users who want ZEC for its privacy properties find this self-defeating.
2. **Privacy coin delistings.** Centralized exchanges are dropping ZEC and other privacy coins. Users need alternatives to acquire and hold ZEC.
3. **Single-chain wallet limitations.** Zcash-specific wallets (Zashi, YWallet) don't support BTC, ETH, or other assets. Users end up managing multiple wallets.
4. **UTXO + EVM fragmentation.** Managing UTXO coins (ZEC, BTC) alongside EVM tokens requires different tools. Users want one interface.
5. **No direct swap path.** Users holding BTC or ETH who want ZEC typically have to go through a centralized exchange. They need a direct swap.
6. **Custody risk on exchanges.** Users who buy ZEC on a CEX don't hold their own keys until they withdraw — and some CEXs restrict ZEC withdrawals.

| 2 | CEXs are dropping Zcash. Self-custody platforms are picking it up. | Privacy coin delistings | X |
| 3 | Your ZEC wallet can't hold your ETH. Your ETH wallet can't hold your ZEC. Until now. | Single-chain limitations | X, Discord |
| 4 | Want to swap BTC into ZEC without creating an exchange account? That's the idea. | No direct swap path | X |
| 5 | Privacy coins on a KYC exchange. Think about that for a second. | KYC gatekeeping (irony) | X, Farcaster |
| 6 | ZEC in one wallet. BTC in another. ETH in a third. There's a better way. | UTXO + EVM fragmentation | X |
| 7 | The original privacy coin deserves a self-custodial home. ZEC is live on ShapeShift. | Custody risk / delistings | X, Discord |

## Press Angles (Problem-Led)

| # | Headline Pitch | Description | Target Outlet |
|---|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | Where Do Privacy Coin Users Go When Exchanges Delist? | As Binance, OKX, and others drop ZEC support, a growing number of Zcash holders are turning to self-custodial platforms. ShapeShift's ZEC integration shows how decentralized infrastructure fills the gap. Angle: the delisting trend, user behavior shift, and what comes next. | Decrypt, CoinDesk |
| 2 | The KYC Paradox: Why Buying a Privacy Coin Requires Your Identity | Most places to acquire ZEC require full KYC — which contradicts why users want ZEC in the first place. This piece maps the landscape of no-KYC access to Zcash and positions ShapeShift as part of the solution. | The Block, Unchained |
| 3 | UTXO Meets EVM: The Challenge of a Multi-Chain Self-Custody Wallet | BTC and ZEC use the UTXO model. ETH uses accounts. Supporting both in one wallet is an engineering and UX challenge. This piece covers how ShapeShift approaches it and what it means for the multi-chain future. | Bankless, The Defiant |
| 4 | Self-Custody vs CEX for Zcash: What You're Actually Trading Off | A comparison: what do users lose or gain by holding ZEC on a CEX vs a self-custodial wallet like ShapeShift? Fees, withdrawal restrictions, custody risk, KYC exposure. Data-driven, not promotional. | CoinDesk, Decrypt |
| 5 | Zcash at 10: How the Original Privacy Coin Is Finding New Distribution | Zcash launched in 2016 as a pioneer of zk-SNARKs. A decade later, its distribution is shifting away from centralized exchanges. This profile covers Zcash's evolution and the platforms keeping it accessible. | Decrypt, The Block |

## Community Conversation Starters

| # | Prompt | Platform | Goal |
|---|--------|----------|------|
| 1 | Where do you buy ZEC right now? Curious how people are acquiring it as exchanges pull support. | X, Discord, Reddit r/zec | User research, surfaces pain points, drives awareness of ShapeShift as alternative |
| 2 | Transparent vs shielded ZEC — which do you use more and why? | Discord, Farcaster | Education, engagement, surfaces use cases |
| 3 | What's in your privacy stack? ZEC, XMR, both, neither? What else? | X, Discord | Engagement, surfaces privacy-adjacent audience |
| 4 | If you could swap any asset into ZEC without KYC — what would you swap? | X, Farcaster | Product validation, engagement, drives awareness |
| 5 | Unpopular opinion: most people who hold ZEC on exchanges don't actually control their ZEC. Agree or disagree? | X, Reddit | Debate, engagement, positions self-custody as the standard |

## How to Use These

- **Social:** Pick 2-3 hooks per week for the content calendar. Rotate between problem-led hooks (from this doc) and announcement-led posts (from drafts/).
- **Press:** Use headline pitches as story subjects when pitching outlets. Pair with the press release from `press/press_release.md` and the PR brief from `press/pr_brief.md`.
- **Community:** Post 1-2 conversation starters per week in Discord #general or Reddit r/zec. Respond to every reply.
- **Calendar:** Add these to `calendar/content_calendar.md` — interleave with existing announcement cadence so weeks 2-4 aren't just "hey we launched this."
- **SEO:** Cross-reference with `research/seo_topics.md` — social hooks can become blog intros, and vice versa.
