## Notes

- CTAs are channel-specific. Replace placeholders like `[BLOG LINK]` and `[X THREAD LINK]` before posting.
- Day 0 = launch day. Shift all dates once launch date is confirmed.
- Farcaster posts appear in weeks 2, 3, and 4 to extend reach beyond X/Discord.
- Rotate between problem-led hooks, educational content, benefit posts, and community engagement — avoid repeating the same angle two days in a row.
