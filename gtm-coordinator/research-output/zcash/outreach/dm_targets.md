# DM Targets: Zcash Launch

**Best Practices:**
- No links in first DM
- First 30 chars = value hook
- Ask "want the link?" to get response first
- This is a live launch — say "ZEC is live on ShapeShift" (not "we're exploring")

---

## Category 1: Zcash Ecosystem Accounts

### 1. Electric Coin Company (ECC)
**Handle:** @ElectricCoinCo
**Why:** ECC builds and maintains Zcash. A retweet or acknowledgment from ECC puts ShapeShift in front of the core Zcash community.
**Opener angle:** New self-custody access point for ZEC holders

**Suggested DM:**
```
ZEC is live on ShapeShift — send, receive, and swap with full self-custody. No KYC. Thought your community would want to know. Want the details?
```

---

### 2. Zcash Foundation
**Handle:** @ZcashFoundation
**Why:** The Foundation funds Zcash development and community growth. They signal-boost ecosystem integrations.
**Opener angle:** Expanding ZEC access through self-custodial infrastructure

**Suggested DM:**
```
ShapeShift now supports ZEC — send, receive, and swap, self-custodial, no KYC. This extends ZEC access as CEXs continue delisting privacy coins. Interested in coordinating an announcement?
```

---

### 3. Zashi Wallet
**Handle:** @ZashiApp
**Why:** Zashi is the official Zcash wallet. ShapeShift complements Zashi by adding multi-asset support and swap capability.
**Opener angle:** Complementary access — Zashi for shielded, ShapeShift for multi-asset

**Suggested DM:**
```
ZEC is live on ShapeShift with send, receive, and swap. We see this as complementary to Zashi — ShapeShift adds multi-asset support and swaps for ZEC holders. Interested in a co-announcement?
```

---

### 4. Zcash Community (@zcaborzcash or Zcash community accounts)
**Handle:** @zcaborzcash / [community handles — verify before sending]
**Why:** Community accounts amplify ecosystem news to ZEC holders directly.
**Opener angle:** New way for community members to access ZEC

**Suggested DM:**

**Why:** Zcash's founder and most visible advocate. An acknowledgment carries weight with the entire Zcash ecosystem.
**Opener angle:** Self-custody ZEC access expanding

**Suggested DM:**

```

### 8. The Zcash Podcast / Digital Cash Network

```

---

### 10. BTC Sessions
**Handle:** @BTCsessions
**Why:** Bitcoin educator focused on self-custody tools. His audience overlaps with privacy coin interest.
**Opener angle:** Self-custody tool now supports ZEC alongside BTC

**Suggested DM:**

## Category 4: Crypto Wallet Comparison Accounts

### 11. Coin Bureau
**Handle:** @coinaboreau

---

## Category 5: DeFi/Crypto Media

### 14. Decrypt
**Handle:** @decaborypt
**Why:** Covers crypto integrations and privacy-related stories. A Zcash integration at a self-custody platform as CEXs delist is newsworthy.
**Opener angle:** Privacy coin access story as CEX delistings accelerate

**Suggested DM:**
```
ShapeShift just launched ZEC support — self-custody send, receive, and swap, no KYC. Relevant angle: as CEXs delist privacy coins, self-custody platforms are becoming the access layer. Story pitch or tip? Happy to share details.
```

---

### 15. CoinDesk
**Handle:** @CoinDesk
**Why:** Major outlet. ZEC integration alone may not warrant coverage, but the "privacy coin access shrinking on CEXs" narrative gives it a hook.
**Opener angle:** Trend piece: where do privacy coin users go when CEXs delist?

**Suggested DM:**
```
As privacy coins get delisted from CEXs, self-custody platforms are picking up the slack. ShapeShift just went live with ZEC — send, receive, swap, no KYC. Could be a trend piece angle. Interested?
```

---

### 16. The Block
**Handle:** @TheBlock__
**Why:** Data-driven outlet. Could tie in ZEC on-chain transaction data with the integration story.
**Opener angle:** On-chain data angle: ZEC usage shifting from CEXs to self-custody

**Suggested DM:**
```
ZEC is now on ShapeShift — self-custody send, receive, swap, no KYC. We're seeing a broader trend of privacy coin access moving off CEXs. Interested in a data angle or quick brief?
```

---

### 17. Unchained (Laura Shin)
**Handle:** @laurashin
**Why:** Covers privacy and self-custody themes. Her audience is sophisticated and values the philosophical angle.
**Opener angle:** Self-custody as the answer to privacy coin delistings

**Suggested DM:**
```
ShapeShift just added ZEC support — self-custodial, no KYC. As centralized platforms pull back from privacy coins, this feels like the kind of trend you cover. Want the details?
```

## Notes

- Verify all handles before sending — some may have changed.
- Personalize openers where possible (reference a recent tweet or piece of content from the target).
- Do not send links in the first DM. Wait for a reply, then share the blog post or app link.
- Exodus is listed as a tracking target, not a DM target.
