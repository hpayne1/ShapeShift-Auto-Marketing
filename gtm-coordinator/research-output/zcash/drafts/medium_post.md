# Send, Receive, and Swap Zcash (ZEC) on ShapeShift

## TL;DR

Zcash (ZEC) is now supported on ShapeShift. Users can send, receive, and swap ZEC using transparent addresses — all self-custodial, no KYC, no account required. Visit [app.shapeshift.com](https://app.shapeshift.com) to get started.

## Privacy Coins Deserve Self-Custodial Access

As centralized exchanges delist or restrict privacy coins, Zcash users face fewer options for managing ZEC without surrendering personal information. ShapeShift offers a self-custodial alternative: connect a wallet, select ZEC, and send, receive, or swap — no KYC, no sign-up, no third-party custody.

### What Is Zcash?

Zcash launched in 2016 with a UTXO-based architecture similar to Bitcoin, adding zk-SNARKs — zero-knowledge proofs that allow transaction details to be verified without revealing them. This made Zcash the first production blockchain to implement zero-knowledge cryptography, giving users the choice between transparent and shielded transactions.

Zcash supports two address types:

- **Transparent addresses (t-addresses):** Similar to Bitcoin — transactions are visible on-chain.
- **Shielded addresses (z-addresses):** Encrypted using zk-SNARKs — amounts, senders, and receivers stay private.

ShapeShift currently supports transparent (t-address) transactions.

### What You Can Do

With ZEC on ShapeShift:

- **Send ZEC** to any transparent Zcash address
- **Receive ZEC** into your self-custodial wallet
- **Swap ZEC** to/from other supported assets

No intermediaries. No identity verification. Users hold their own keys throughout.

### Why It Matters

Financial privacy is under pressure. Exchanges removing ZEC support doesn't change the fact that users want and need privacy-preserving options. A self-custodial interface gives ZEC holders a way to manage their assets on their own terms — no permissions needed.

ShapeShift has no KYC requirements, no account creation process, and no custody of user funds. The user connects a wallet, takes an action, and stays in control.

### How to Get Started

1. Go to [app.shapeshift.com](https://app.shapeshift.com)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Select ZEC from the asset list
4. Send, receive, or swap

That's it. Your keys stay with you.

## Your Keys, Your ZEC

Zcash is one of the most important projects in crypto's history — it proved that zero-knowledge proofs could work at scale. ShapeShift now gives ZEC holders a self-custodial home for their assets.
