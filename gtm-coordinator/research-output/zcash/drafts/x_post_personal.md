QT the main @ShapeShift announcement with:

Zcash was one of the first assets I ever cared about in crypto. The idea that financial privacy is a right, not a feature — that stuck with me. Glad to see ZEC live on ShapeShift with full send, receive, and swap support. No KYC. Self-custodial. As it should be.
