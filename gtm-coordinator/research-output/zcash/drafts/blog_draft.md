# Send, Receive, and Swap Zcash (ZEC) on ShapeShift

## Your keys, your ZEC — the original privacy coin is now on ShapeShift

Zcash holders now have a self-custodial way to send, receive, and swap ZEC on ShapeShift. No KYC. No account sign-up. No third-party custody. Just connect a wallet and go.

As exchanges continue to delist or restrict privacy coins, finding a place to use ZEC without surrendering your identity gets harder every year. ShapeShift offers a different path: a self-custodial interface where users control their own keys and manage ZEC alongside other supported assets.

### What Is Zcash?

Zcash (ZEC) is a cryptocurrency that launched in 2016, building on Bitcoin's UTXO model with one critical addition: zk-SNARKs. These zero-knowledge proofs give users the option to shield transaction details — amounts, senders, and receivers — while still being verified on-chain.

Zcash pioneered the use of zero-knowledge cryptography in production. It offers two address types:

- **Transparent addresses (t-addresses):** Function like Bitcoin addresses — transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain.
- **Shielded addresses (z-addresses):** Use zk-SNARKs to encrypt transaction data while still proving validity.

Zcash's contribution to zero-knowledge cryptography has influenced the entire blockchain space, from Ethereum's rollup ecosystem to privacy-focused protocols across DeFi.

### What Can You Do Now?

With ZEC support on ShapeShift, users can:

- **Send ZEC** to any transparent Zcash address directly from the ShapeShift interface
- **Receive ZEC** into a self-custodial wallet connected to ShapeShift
- **Swap ZEC** to and from other supported assets without leaving the platform

All transactions use transparent (t-address) Zcash addresses. Shielded (z-address) transactions are not supported at this time.

### Why This Matters

Privacy coins face increasing friction on centralized platforms. Many exchanges have delisted ZEC entirely, citing regulatory pressure. For users who believe financial privacy is a right — not a feature to be toggled off by a compliance department — self-custodial access matters.

ShapeShift provides that access. There is no account creation, no identity verification, and no custodial risk. Users connect a wallet they already control and interact with ZEC directly. This is what self-custodial finance looks like in practice: the user holds the keys, the user makes the decisions.

### How to Get Started

Getting started with ZEC on ShapeShift takes less than a minute:

1. **Go to app.shapeshift.com** — No account or sign-up required.
2. **Connect your wallet** — Use any supported wallet (KeepKey, MetaMask via Snaps, or other compatible wallets).
3. **Select ZEC** from the asset list.
4. **Send, receive, or swap** — Choose your action and confirm the transaction.
5. **Done** — Your ZEC stays in your wallet at all times.
