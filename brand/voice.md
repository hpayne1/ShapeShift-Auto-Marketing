## 🔊 Brand Voice

### Tone & Perspective

| Context | Perspective |
|---------|-------------|
| **Main brand account** | 3rd person omniscient (authoritative, trusted) |
| **Contributor comments/QTs** | 1st person allowed |

**Key rule:** The main brand speaks as ShapeShift (the platform), not as "we" casually. Contributors bring the human element.

## 🧰 Core Content Framework

### 1. Product Activation Content

**Structure:**
- All major product posts should be **quote tweeted by a ShapeShift contributor** with added context or walkthrough
- Contributors post face shots, Loom walkthroughs, or app screenshots → main account quote tweets
- **Never post real faces from the main handle** — faces belong to humans, not brands

**Requirements:**
- Product graphics must be clean, simple, and highlight user value
- Where possible, link (or deep link) directly to features:
  - Markets
  - Trending Tokens
  - 1-Click DeFi
  - Specific swap routes

### 2. Data & Metrics

**Publish app metrics regularly:**
- Trading volumes
- Route and pair popularity
- Fee savings
- Chain rankings

**Format:**
- Use data visualizations or simple spreadsheet screenshots
- Don't overdesign — authenticity > polish
- Celebrate trending chains, assets, and monthly rank shifts

### 3. Educational & Informational

- Use visuals or threads to explain unique product features
- Route visualizations for swaps
- Highlight compatible wallets
- Create micro-case studies:
  - Swapper flows
  - rFOX staking
  - 1-click DeFi
  - Crosschain journeys

### 4. Contributor & Partner Spotlights

- Identify influencers/DAO contributors who post organically → amplify
- Encourage partner case studies:
  - Volume milestones
  - Integration wins
  - New chain launches

---

## 💬 Community & Engagement

### Content Themes

- **Humanize the content:** Tie in real users, faces, and stories where possible
- **Ask questions:** About tokens, trading habits, user journeys
- **Drive participation:** Polls, fill-in-the-blanks, prompts
- **Memes:** 1 main post per week allowed. Comments section is fair game.

### Post Psychology

Every post should do at least one of:
- ✅ Incite curiosity
- ✅ Pose a question
- ✅ Include a graphic that builds tension
- ✅ Drive action (clear CTA)

### Community Identity

- Explore community nickname ("FOX Fam", etc.)
- Keep CTAs simple but impactful

---

## 🔁 Post Mechanics

| Type | Guidelines |
|------|------------|
| **Main Launch Post** | Always QT'd by team member(s) with added context |
| **Contributor Post** | Screenshots, Looms, faces → QT'd by main account |
| **Face Photos** | Only allowed from contributors, NEVER main |
| **Memes** | 1x/week from main, comments section is fair game |
| **Threads** | Use for deeper dives (chain rankings, customer journeys) |
| **UGC** | Actively seek it — prompt via questions, polls, or merch incentives |
