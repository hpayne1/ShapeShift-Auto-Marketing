# ShapeShift Content: Do's and Don'ts
## Based on Official Brand Guidelines

---

## ✅ DO

### Voice & Perspective
- Speak in **3rd person omniscient** from main brand account
- Position ShapeShift as authoritative and trusted
- Let contributors use 1st person in QTs and comments
- Be principled: self-custody, privacy, open source, no KYC

### Content Structure
- **QT major launches** with contributor context/walkthrough
- Have contributors post faces, Looms, screenshots → main account QTs
- Use clean, simple product graphics that highlight user value
- Deep link directly to features when possible

### Data & Metrics
- Publish app metrics regularly (volumes, routes, fee savings)
- Use simple data visualizations or spreadsheet screenshots
- Celebrate trending chains, assets, rank shifts
- Keep data posts authentic — don't overdesign

### Engagement
- Ask users questions about tokens, habits, journeys
- Create polls and fill-in-the-blanks
- Actively seek UGC through prompts
- Humanize content with real user stories

### Values to Embody
- Self-custody is king
- Privacy is a human right
- Open source transparency
- No KYC required
- Decentralization & free markets
- User empowerment

## ❌ DON'T

### Voice & Perspective
- **Never post real faces from the main handle** — faces belong to humans, not brands
- Don't use personal or overly informal tone from brand account
- Don't speak as casual "we" from main — save that for contributors
- Don't be preachy about values (show, don't lecture)

### Content Structure
- Don't launch major features without contributor QT support
- Don't overdesign data posts (authenticity > polish)
- Don't bury the value prop in graphics
- Don't skip deep links when they're available

### Frequency Rules
- **Memes:** Max 1x/week from main (comments section is fair game)
- Don't spam engagement posts
- Don't over-post without substance

### Topics to Avoid
- Price predictions or speculation
- Financial advice of any kind
- Competitor bashing
- Political/controversial topics
- Unverified claims
- KYC promotion (we're no-KYC)
