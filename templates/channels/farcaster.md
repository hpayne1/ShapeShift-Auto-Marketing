## Farcaster vs X: Key Differences

| Aspect | X | Farcaster |
|--------|---|-----------|
| Character limit | 280 | 320 |
| Audience | Mainstream crypto | Crypto-native builders |
| Tone | Broad appeal | More technical ok |
| Engagement | Likes, RTs | Likes, recasts, replies |
| Culture | Mixed | Builder-focused, Ethereum-adjacent |

**Farcaster audience is more technical and builder-focused.** You can assume more crypto knowledge and lean into technical details.

---

## Voice Guidelines

**Tone:** Slightly more technical, builder-friendly, authentic. Less polished marketing, more "here's what we built."

**What works on Farcaster:**
- Technical details that would be too much for X
- Builder-to-builder communication
- Shipping updates ("just shipped X")
- Integration announcements with technical context
- Engaging with the Farcaster community directly

**What to avoid:**
- Overly corporate/polished messaging
- Generic marketing speak
- Ignoring replies (engagement matters more here)
