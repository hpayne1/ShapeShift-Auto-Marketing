## Discord vs X: Key Differences

| Aspect | X | Discord |
|--------|---|---------|
| Audience | Public, discovery | Community, engaged |
| Tone | Punchy, viral | Warmer, detailed |
| Length | 280 chars | Up to 2000 chars |
| Formatting | Limited | Rich (bold, links, embeds) |
| Engagement | Likes, RTs | Reactions, replies |

**Discord is for your community.** They already know ShapeShift. You can be more detailed, more personal, and assume more context.

---

## Voice Guidelines

**Tone:** Friendly, informative, community-first. Like talking to friends who care about the product.

**Formatting to use:**
- **Bold** for emphasis
- `code blocks` for technical terms
- Bullet points for lists
- Emojis for visual breaks (but don't overdo it)
- Line breaks for readability

**Community language:**
- "foxes" — ShapeShift community members (use sparingly)
- "we" and "our" — inclusive language
- Address the reader directly: "you can now..."

## Example: Starknet Launch on Discord

```
📣 **Starknet is Now Live on ShapeShift!**

Hey foxes! 🦊

We just shipped Starknet support across ShapeShift. You can now swap to and from Starknet directly in the app.

**What you can do:**
✅ Swap any chain → STRK (ETH, BTC, SOL, and 23 more)
✅ Swap STRK → any supported chain
✅ Access Starknet DeFi protocols
✅ Manage your Starknet portfolio alongside everything else

**Why Starknet?**
Starknet is an L2 with serious DeFi momentum. With this integration, you can access Starknet yields and swaps without leaving ShapeShift — and without giving up your keys.

**How to try it:**
1. Go to app.shapeshift.com
2. Connect your wallet
3. Select STRK as your destination asset
4. Swap!

We're also working on deeper DeFi integrations with Starknet protocols. Stay tuned.

**Try it now:** https://app.shapeshift.com
