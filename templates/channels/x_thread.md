# X Thread Template
## Multi-Tweet Thread (3-10 tweets)

---

## When to Use Threads

- Feature launches that need explanation
- Educational content ("How to...")
- Announcements with multiple components
- Storytelling (year in review, roadmap)
- Deeper dives that don't fit in one tweet

---

## Thread Structure

### Opening Tweet (The Hook)
This is the most important tweet. It must:
- Stop the scroll
- Promise value
- Make people want to click "Show this thread"

**Patterns:**
- Bold claim → "Here's why..."
- Question → Answer coming
- "🧵 [Topic]" signal
- Numbered list tease: "5 things you can now do..."

### Middle Tweets (The Meat)
- One idea per tweet
- Each tweet should stand alone (people share individual tweets)
- Use numbering if it's a list (1/, 2/, 3/ or 1. 2. 3.)
- Include visuals where helpful

### Closing Tweet (The CTA)
- Summarize the key point
- Clear call to action
- Link to product/resource
- Invite engagement ("Questions? Reply below")

## Thread Best Practices

### Do:
- Number your tweets (helps readers track progress)
- Keep each tweet under 280 chars
- Use line breaks for readability
- Include 1-2 images/videos in the thread
- End with a clear CTA
- Self-reply immediately (don't let others break the thread)

### Don't:
- Make threads longer than necessary (respect people's time)
- Bury the value (if tweet 1 doesn't hook, they won't read)
- Use every tweet as a sales pitch
- Forget to include the link
- Thread things that should be one tweet

---

## Thread Length Guidelines

| Content Type | Ideal Length |
|--------------|--------------|
| Feature launch | 4-6 tweets |
| How-to guide | 4-5 tweets |
| Chain integration | 5-7 tweets |
| Year review | 5-8 tweets |
| Deep dive | 7-10 tweets |
