## Example: Starknet Integration Post

```markdown
# Starknet Swaps Are Now Live on ShapeShift

**Meta:** ShapeShift now supports Starknet. Swap any asset to STRK, access Starknet DeFi, and manage your L2 portfolio—all self-custodial.

---

We're excited to announce that Starknet is now fully supported on ShapeShift. You can swap to and from Starknet directly in the app, access Starknet DeFi protocols, and manage your STRK alongside all your other assets.

This integration brings Starknet's high-performance L2 to ShapeShift's multichain ecosystem—meaning you can now go from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, or any of our 26 supported chains directly to Starknet in one click.

## Why Starknet?

Starknet is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that uses STARK proofs to achieve high throughput and low fees while maintaining Ethereum's security guarantees.

For ShapeShift users, Starknet opens up:

- **Lower fees:** Transaction costs are a fraction of Ethereum mainnet
- **Fast finality:** Transactions confirm quickly
- **Growing DeFi:** Access to Starknet-native protocols and yields
- **BTCfi opportunity:** Starknet's focus on Bitcoin DeFi aligns with ShapeShift's native BTC capabilities

## What You Can Do

### Cross-Chain Swaps

Swap from any ShapeShift-supported chain directly to STRK:

- ETH → STRK
- BTC → STRK (native Bitcoin, not wrapped)
- SOL → STRK
- And 23 more chains

No bridging required. No wrapped tokens. One transaction.

### Starknet DeFi Access

Access Starknet DeFi protocols through ShapeShift's interface. Stake, provide liquidity, and earn yield—all while keeping custody of your keys.

### Portfolio Management

View your Starknet assets alongside your entire multichain portfolio. One interface, all your assets.

## How to Get Started

1. Go to [app.shapeshift.com](https://app.shapeshift.com)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Select STRK as your destination asset
4. Choose your source asset and amount
5. Review and confirm the swap

That's it. Your STRK will arrive in your connected wallet.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning of our Starknet integration. We're working on:

- Deeper DeFi integrations with Starknet protocols
- Enhanced yield opportunities
- Agent.ShapeShift support for natural language Starknet interactions

Stay tuned for updates.
