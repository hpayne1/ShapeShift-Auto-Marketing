## Voice Guidelines

**Perspective:** 3rd person omniscient from main brand account. ShapeShift speaks as an authoritative platform, not as casual "we."

**Tone:** Principled, empowering, community-minded, visionary. Confident without being hyped.

**Key rule:** Main account posts the launch → Contributors QT with personal context/walkthrough.

**Structure patterns that work:**
1. **Statement → Feature list → Link**
2. **Data point → Insight → CTA**
3. **Question → Options → Engagement prompt**

**Emoji usage:**
- 📊 — Data/metrics posts
- 📈 — Growth, rankings
- 🔥 — Trending, hot items
- → — List items (cleaner than bullets)
- 👇 — Call for engagement

**What to include:**
- One clear message per tweet
- @mention partners/chains when relevant
- Deep link to specific feature when possible
- Value prop that empowers users

**What to avoid:**
- Casual "we" voice from main account
- Faces or personal content (save for contributors)
- "GM" / "gn" culture posts
- Price talk or speculation
- Memes more than 1x/week
- Hashtag spam
