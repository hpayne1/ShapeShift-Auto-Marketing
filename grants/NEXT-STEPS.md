# Starknet Grant: Next Steps

## Action Plan to Submit Proposal

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Submission Prep (This Week)

### 1. Research Starknet Grant Process
- [ ] Find the official Starknet grants page / application portal
- [ ] Understand their evaluation criteria
- [ ] Check if there's a specific format they require
- [ ] Look at past approved grants for reference
- [ ] Note any deadlines or funding cycles

**Questions to answer:**
- Do they have specific categories (ecosystem, marketing, etc.)?
- What's the typical grant size they approve?
- Do they require milestones/tranches or lump sum?
- Who reviews applications?

### 2. Confirm Integration Timeline
- [ ] When will Agent.ShapeShift Starknet integration be ready?
- [ ] When will App.ShapeShift Starknet support ship?
- [ ] Are there dependencies that could delay?

**Why this matters:** The GTM campaign should align with actual ship dates. If integration is 3 months out, the campaign should start then.

### 3. Lock Down the Numbers
Current proposed budget:
```
Human Oversight:    $3,000/month × 6 = $18,000 (36%)
Paid Amplification: $5,000/month × 6 = $30,000 (60%)
Tooling/Creative:   $333/month × 6   = $2,000  (4%)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total:                                 $50,000
```

- [ ] Confirm you're comfortable with $3K/month
- [ ] Decide if you want milestone-based payments or monthly
- [ ] Prepare to justify the split if asked

## Phase 2: Strengthen the Proposal

### 4. Demo the GTM System
Before submitting, have something to show:

- [ ] Create a sample GTM plan YAML for a fake "Starknet Launch"
- [ ] Generate sample content using the workflow
- [ ] Screenshot the process / record a Loom
- [ ] Show the approval gates and tracking

**Goal:** "Here's the system in action" proof, not just a pitch deck.

### 5. Define Success Metrics
Be specific about what you'll deliver:

| Metric | 6-Month Target | How Measured |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Content pieces published | 100+ | GTM system count |
| X impressions | TBD | X Analytics |
| Tracked clicks (UTM) | TBD | Analytics dashboard |
| On-chain swaps | TBD | On-chain data |

- [ ] Set realistic targets based on current X engagement
- [ ] Define how you'll attribute on-chain activity to the campaign

### 6. Prepare Reporting Cadence
Starknet will want to see progress:

- [ ] Weekly summary (automated from system)
- [ ] Monthly detailed report (you write)
- [ ] Final retrospective at 6 months

---

## Phase 3: Submit

### 7. Tailor Proposal to Their Format
- [ ] Adapt `starknet-gtm-proposal.md` to their application format
- [ ] Trim or expand sections as needed
- [ ] Add any required legal/compliance language

### 8. Submit & Follow Up
- [ ] Submit via their official process
- [ ] Note any confirmation / tracking number
- [ ] Set reminder to follow up if no response in 2 weeks
- [ ] Be ready for questions / clarifications

---

## Phase 4: If Approved

### 9. Set Up Execution Infrastructure
- [ ] Create the actual GTM plan YAMLs in `.gtm/` folder
- [ ] Set up UTM tracking / analytics dashboard
- [ ] Configure any automation (scheduling, posting)
- [ ] Set up reporting template

### 10. Kick Off Campaign
- [ ] Align campaign start with integration ship date
- [ ] Begin content generation → review → publish cycle
- [ ] Activate paid ads
- [ ] Start weekly reporting rhythm

## Quick Reference: Key Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `starknet-gtm-proposal.md` | Full proposal for submission |
| `starknet-execution-plan.md` | Technical details (share if asked) |
| `starknet-one-pager.md` | Quick pitch / talking points |
| `NEXT-STEPS.md` | This action plan |

## Questions to Answer Before Submitting

1. **Integration timeline:** When does Starknet support actually ship?
2. **Existing relationship:** Do you have a contact at Starknet Foundation?
3. **Competing priorities:** Can you commit 15 hrs/week for 6 months?
4. **Metric targets:** What's realistic given current X engagement?
5. **Fallback plan:** What if integration is delayed mid-campaign?

---

## Optional: Strengthen the Pitch

### If you have time:
- [ ] Get a testimonial from someone who's seen the GTM system
- [ ] Show previous ShapeShift marketing performance data
- [ ] Connect with someone at Starknet for informal feedback first
- [ ] Look for co-marketing opportunities with Starknet ecosystem projects

### If you want to de-risk:
- [ ] Propose milestone-based funding (e.g., $25K at start, $25K at 3 months)
- [ ] Offer to do a 1-month pilot for $8K before full commitment
- [ ] Include a "what if integration delays" contingency in proposal
