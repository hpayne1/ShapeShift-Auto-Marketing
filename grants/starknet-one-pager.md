## The Pitch (30-second version)

Give us $50K over 6 months, and we'll execute a full Starknet GTM campaign—100+ pieces of content, tracked clicks, measurable on-chain conversions. 60% goes to paid amplification, 36% to campaign execution, 4% to tooling. Every dollar tracked, every piece auditable."

| Manual reporting | Automated tracking + reporting |
| "Trust us" deliverables | Every piece tracked in system |
| One-time spend | Templates reusable for future |
| Slow turnaround | Rapid iteration |

## Quick Answers

**Q: Why not just hire a marketing agency?**
> Agency gives you X posts for $Y. We're building a system that generates 10X posts and leaves behind infrastructure for future campaigns at near-zero marginal cost.

**Q: What if the AI content is bad?**
> Every piece goes through human approval gates. The AI drafts, humans approve. If something slips through, it gets flagged and we adjust.

**Q: How do I know you'll actually use the money for this?**
> Every piece of content is tracked in our GTM system with timestamps, approvals, and attribution. We'll share access to the system or provide regular exports. Full transparency.

**Q: What happens after 6 months?**
> The infrastructure we build persists. Future Starknet campaigns can run through the same system at minimal cost. Plus, we'll have a proven playbook.
