# ShapeShift x Starknet: AI-Powered GTM Grant Proposal

**Requested Amount:** $50,000 USD  
**Duration:** 6 months  
**Applicant:** ShapeShift DAO

---

## Executive Summary

ShapeShift requests $50,000 to execute an **AI-assisted go-to-market campaign** for Starknet integrations across two flagship products:

| Product | Focus | Grant Ask |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **agent.shapeshift.com** | AI Agent for DeFi | $25,000 |
| **app.shapeshift.com** | Multi-chain wallet | $25,000 |

**What makes this different:** This GTM will be executed using ShapeShift's **Auto-Marketing Platform**—an AI-assisted content pipeline that generates, coordinates, and deploys marketing assets with human oversight at approval gates. The result: more content, faster iteration, and full transparency.

---

## Why This Matters for Starknet

### 1. Distribution
- ShapeShift's X presence: 100K+ followers
- Agent.ShapeShift is emerging as a gateway to DeFi for AI-native users
- Both products will surface Starknet as a first-class chain for swaps, yields, and DeFi
- Open-source community with engaged contributors

### 2. The Multiplier Effect
Traditional grant marketing: Pay agency → get X posts → done.

**AI-Assisted GTM:**
- Generates more content variants, faster
- Tests messaging across channels simultaneously  
- Continuously optimizes based on performance
- Leaves behind reusable templates for future Starknet campaigns

### 3. Transparent & Measurable
Every piece of content is:
- Tracked via UTM parameters back to Starknet
- Auditable in our GTM coordination system
- Reported with clear attribution metrics

### Key Differentiator: Structured GTM Plans

Every campaign initiative is tracked in a YAML plan file:
- **Provenance:** Git SHA, PRs, inputs that triggered the campaign
- **Tier:** Determines required content (Tier 2 = full blitz)
- **Risk:** Determines approval requirements
- **Channels:** Status tracked per channel (pending → generated → approved → published)
- **Gates:** QA and Marketing must approve before publishing
- **History:** Full audit log of all changes

This means Starknet gets:
- Complete transparency into what was created and when
- Attribution data for every piece of content
- Ability to audit the entire campaign at any time

| **Clicks to Starknet Actions** | 50K+ | UTM-tracked links |
| **New Starknet Swaps via ShapeShift** | 10K+ | On-chain analytics |
